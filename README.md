### Hey, my name is Ben, and I am a software engineer from AZ!

Hello world! I am an AZ native born into nerd-dom. I built my first desktop when I was 8 and seems only fit that I get into coding eventually. In 2019 I started at Lambda School and very quickly became a leader to my peers, offering additional instruction to those who need it. Since then I have grown to accept multiple development positions, including my current as a Senior Software Engineer, as well as start my own community of practice, which I have co-hosted for over a year.

I take pride in being able to do as many things as possible. Not to be selfish, but to make me as valuable as I can on a team. But have you ever gotten a quote on new counter tops? Yikes. I will do it myself.

#### My coding beliefs --

- **Reusable Code:** Nothing is worse than having to write the same thing over and over again. I believe you need to let the code do the heavy lifting and write it in a manner that is functional and dynamic.
- **Break It Down:** It is best to take big problems and cut them up into bite sized problems. This helps to solve each piece with much more care and speed.
- **Sit Down, Be Humble**: You can learn something from everyone if you allow yourself to be humble and listen. Humility is the key ingredient to growing and that is all I have ever aspired to do.

#### Why I code --

For years I have had a passion for building things. Everything from leather sheathes, holsters, and tool scabbards to knives, furniture, residential gates and even commercial structures. Coding gives me the ability to create anything I can imagine without any materials, physical labor, or even leaving my desk.
